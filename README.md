# Pure Javascript Music Player for Color Detection

My goal in this project was to refactor the code we wrote with the udemy trainer and add new features.

I rewrote the styling for the UI and used scss.
I stored the most dominant color in the background image of each changing music with Vibrant.js and pressed the card and the background of the lyrics screen.

## Libraries I Use

UI Library: https://getbootstrap.com/

Icon: https://fontawesome.com/

Image Color Detection: https://jariz.github.io/vibrant.js/
